							<strong>4G LTE Advanced</strong>
						</h2>
						<p>
							<strong>Overview:</strong>
						</p>
						<p>The Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard defined by 3GPP is a
							highly flexible radio interface that aims at bridging the gap
							between 3G and 4G standards. LTE Release 8 specification was
							completed in 2009 and triggered LTE service deployment by leading
							mobile network operators. It has set various target requirements
							to achieve higher system performance than HSPA in 3GPP Release 6.
							It has improved system capacity, cell edge user throughput and
							lower C/U plane latency, supported by introduction of new radio
							interface technologies, such as OFDM, frequency domain scheduling
							and MIMO. In the following year, LTE Release 9 has also been
							completed to extend various functionalities in LTE Rel.8. The
							area of enhancement includes closed subscriber group (CSG),
							self-organizing network (SON), and new functionalities such as
							location information service and MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast and
							Multicast Service).</p>

							<strong>LTE Advanced:</strong>
						</p>
						<p>To keep up with the today's rapidly growing traffic,
							especially by the wide spread of smart phone devices, it became
							necessary to achieve much higher level of system performance,
							while keeping the backward compatibility. Accordingly, the radio
							access interface specifications for LTE-Advanced has been
							developed in 2011. LTE-Advanced (LTE Rel.10 and beyond) sets a
							major important milestone in standardization where meets and
							exceeds requirements set by IMT-Advanced for 4G (International
							Mobile Telecommunications). The new requirements include spectral
							efficiency, higher bandwidth, and lower latency. To meet these
							competitive requirements, a series of new technologies have been
							introduced into LTE-Advanced, such as Carrier Aggregation,
							Enhanced MIMO, and CoMP (Coordinated multi-point
							transmission/reception). LTE-Advanced will enable higher than
							1Gbps downlink bandwidth in addition to the existing LTE service
							and open a new era of true wireless broadband services in the
							near future. LTE-Advanced services will become available from
							leading mobile network operators around 2014. Additional features
							include non-contiguous spectra usage to further enhance the
							current LTE services.</p>

						<p>SAI Technology has been heavily engaged in LTE product
							development from the early stages of LTE standards. SAI has
							demonstrated complete end to end system solutions for eNodeB and
							UE for LTE-Release 8 and 9. SAI is developing LTE advancements to
							fulfill new and future generations of LTE products. SAI is
							committed to delivery of LTE Advanced (Release 10 and beyond)
							products by March 2012.</p>

						<h2>802.11 AC / AD / WiGiga</h2>
						<p>
							<strong>Overview:</strong>
						</p>
						<p>In 2009, 802.11n was ratified. It provides for up to 4x4
							MIMO (Single user) along with wider bandwidths and a number of
							MAC layer improvements leading to a peak theoretical throughput
							in the order of 600 Mbps. Since the ratification of 802.11n, a
							new task group (TGac) has begun working on the next standard for
							even higher throughput within &lt;6GHz spectrum. A closely
							coupled task group (TGad) is looking at very high throughput for
							spectrum &gt;6Ghz (such as the 60 Ghz ISM band).</p>
						<p>The IEEE 802.11ac Task Group (TG) has beendeveloping
							amendment to IEEE 802.11 having PHY (Physical layer) as well as
							MAC (Medium Access Control sub layer) enhancements.&nbsp; These
							are the following goals for designing the IEEE 802.11ac
							amendment.</p>
						<p>&bull; Backward compatibility with IEEE 802.11a and IEEE
							802.11n operated in 5GHz.</p>
						<p>&bull; Single STA throughput: 802.11ac STA shall be capable
							of getting throughput up to 500Mbps.</p>
						<p>&bull; Multi-STA throughput: The aggregate throughput when
							802.11ac system has multiple STAs connected should be greater
							than or equal to 1Gbps.</p>
						<p>New features in this standard are the bandwidths of 80 MHz
							and 160 MHz (11n offered only 40 MHz), 256QAM, up to eight
							antennas and multi-user MIMO.Gross data rates of 293 Mbit/s are
							possible with only 80 MHz bandwidth, one antenna and 64QAM 5/6;
							all 802.11ac devices must support this mode. Optional modes using
							256QAM and eight antennas under optimal conditions permit gross
							data rates of 3.5 Gbit/s. 802.11ac is designed only for
							license-free 5 GHz bands and will no longer include the 2.4 GHz
							industrial scientific medical (ISM) band previously used
							primarily for WLANs.</p>
						<p>For details on the exact extensions in the PHY layer, see
							our whitepaper on 802.11ac PHY extensions.</p>
						<p>SAI is developing 802.11ac PHY and MAC layer stacks, as
							well as system solutions with particular emphasis on MU-MIMO high
							performance implementation. This work is in collaboration with
							leading silicon and SoC vendors for 802.11ac.&nbsp;</p>

						</p>
						<p>Concurrent with the802.11ac developments, a number of
							industry groups are looking at the ISM band at 60 Ghz (typically
							57-66 Ghz) as the next frontier for WLANs. Clearly, such a high
							center frequency (mm wave) comes with a number of challenges
							including</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Limited range, due to the proximity of the oxygen
								absorption band</li>
							<li>Implementation cost and high power consumption</li>
						</ul>
						<p>MIMO techniques are helping overcome at least some of the
							range issue, and a 32x32 antenna array can be easily implemented
							on a CMOS process. Thus, as these hurdles are overcome the 60
							Ghzband promises even higher data rates &ndash; up to 7 Gbps.</p>
						<p>The IEEE 802.11ad standard adds a mm wave operating mode to
							the 802.11n with a mmSTA being a station that is capable of mm
							wave operations. Although the base protocol is an extension of
							802.11n and 802.11ac, a number of mmWave mode specific packets
							and formats have been defined in this standard(for e.g., mmWave
							CTS). In addition, upto 5 bits are reserved for defining the
							number of beams, thus permitting as many as 32 beams.</p>
						<p>Due to the strong dependence on beamforming, considerable
							effort is going into refining the beam forming procedures and
							transactions within the 802.11ad standard. Similarly the large
							number of receive and transmit chains required for such a system
							are pushing the standards committee to refine the power
							management techniques used in 802.11n/ac. MIMO for reducing power
							consumption and turning off some of these chains when not
							required without affecting network latency and performance.</p>
						<p>This standard is in draft and still being developed,
							although initial silicon is available from a select set of
							companies.</p>
						<p>Besides the 802.11ad standard, a few other standards are
							being pursued for the 60 Ghz ISM band.</p>
						<p>SAI is working with leading 60 GHz chip vendors for
							802.11ad implementation on CMOS platforms. This work clearly
							leverages SAI&rsquo;s work on 802.11ac with a focus on high
							performance and low power solutions.</p>
						<p>
							<strong>WiGig</strong>
						</p>
						<p>The WiGig specification was contributed to the IEEE
							802.11ad standardization process, and was confirmed in May 2010
							as the basis for the 802.11ad draft standard.</p>

							<strong>Wireless Video </strong>
						</h2>
						<p>
							<strong>Overview:</strong>
						</p>
						<p>In parallel with the 802.11 stream of standards, there has
							been a steady march of Wireless personal area networks towards
							the 60 Ghz ISM band as well. In particular the requirements of
							being able to develop a wireless video area network for full HD
							resolution leads towards similarly high data rate requirements.</p>
						<p>The latest Wireless HD 1.1 standard aims for</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Stream uncompressed audio and video up to Quad Full HD
								(QFHD) resolution,</li>
							<li>48 bit color and 240 Hz refresh rates</li>
							<li>Support for 3D video formats</li>
							<li>Efficient data networking using IP</li>
							<li>Flexible wireless connectivity using USB bridging</li>
							<li>Simple, fast file transfer with OBEX.</li>
							<li>Low rate PHY (2.5-40 Mb/s) for omni-directional control
								and discovery</li>
							<li>Medium-rate PHY (0.5-2 Gb/s) for low power, mobile
								applications and lowcomplexityuniversal bi-directional data
								support</li>
							<li>High-rate PHY (1-7 Gb/s) for high quality, full
								resolution video</li>
							<li>Improved coverage and higher data rates (in excess of 28
								Gb/s) through the use of</li>
							<li>The spatial multiplexing high rate PHY (SM-HRP) option</li>
							<li>Video coding to improve link robustness</li>
							<li>HDCP 2.0 in addition to DTCP content protection support</li>
						</ul>
						<p>SAI has completed significant work in video streaming on
							existing protocols &ndash; WiMax, LTE as well as 802.11 in their
							various forms (802.16e, 802.16d, 3G,LTE Rel 9 as well as
							802.11g/n/ac). SAI is extending such video streaming work into
							the Wireless High Definition technologies and markets for high
							performance full resolution video.</p>
