						<h3>Defense</h3>
						<p>
							SAI Technology has a long history of serving Defense customers
							for the past 10 years. <br\="">
						</p>
						<p>
							SAI provides very unique technology leadership in the 4G/5G
							Wireless, SDN, Unified Mobility Cloud and Cyber Security
							solutions.<br>
						</p>
						<p>
							SAI worked with various companies in the Defense and Aerospace
							field such as Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, Boeing, Cubic
							Systems, Loral Space Systems….etc. <br>
						</p>
						<p>SAI supports advanced Research &amp; Development in 4G/5G
							wireless and Cyber Security for mission critical Defense and
							Aerospace applications.</p>
						<p>
							SAI's 4G/5G Wireless core technology enables generation of
							various customized waveforms for the Defense and Aerospace
							applications, such as Software Defined Radio (SDR), Software
							Defined Networks (SDN) and Cyber Security. <br\="">
						</p>
						<h5>Key Challenges in the development of SDR and SDN
							Waveforms</h5>
						<p>The paradigm of SDR and SDN poses new challenges or makes
							current design challenges more stringent. The most relevant
							challenges are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><b><u>Flexibility</u></b>: In SDR, SDN and cognitive
								radio devices there are different design goals. For example,
								efficient multi-mode or multi-waveform RF transmission must
								comply with new and old air interfaces to deliver
								interoperability. Additionally it supports multiple algorithms
								and reduction of costs via modular and parametric design. In
								this context, the term waveform represents a complete wireless
								standard, e.g. GSM, UMTS, WiMAX, 3G, 4G, 5G, WiFi, Satellite
								Waveforms etc.</li>
							<li><b><u>Efficiency</u></b>: To drive power and space
								savings through efficient waveforms of SDR and SDN, battery life
								is extended.</li>
							<li><b><u>Design</u></b>: Between flexibility and efficiency
								for SDR and SDN, the design challenge is the contradictory
								nature and presence of several hard real-time waveform
								constraints like low latency and high throughput. This makes
								heterogeneous multi-processor system-on-chips (MPSoCs) an
								inevitable candidate as the hardware platform for the solution.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Heterogeneous MPSoCs with specialized processing elements
							can pave the way to solve the dilemma of contradicting demands of
							high computational performance on one hand and energy efficiency
							on the other. However, designing such a system is highly complex,
							tedious, error-prone and faced with design space constraint and
							early verification. What is needed is a description method that
							can lead to a automatic generation of a waveform implementation
							directly from the specification. Therefore a methodology is
							required that raises the abstraction level of waveform design to
							make it manageable.</p>

							various strategic business and engagement models.</p>
						<p>
							<img src="./Sai Technology defense_files/govt1.png">
						</p>
						<h5>4G LTE Advanced Solutions:</h5>
						<p>The Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard defined by 3GPP is a
							highly flexible radio interface that aims at bridging the gap
							between 3G and 4G standards. LTE Release 8 specification was
							completed in 2009. Since then SAI also had solutions for
							LTE-Release - 9,10,11,12. And triggered LTE service deployment by
							leading mobile network operators. It has set various target
							requirements to achieve higher system performance than HSPA in
							3GPP Release 6. It has improved system capacity, cell edge user
							throughput and lower C/U plane latency, supported by introduction
							of new radio interface technologies, such as OFDM, frequency
							domain scheduling and MIMO. In the following year, LTE Release 9
							has also been completed to extend various functionalities in LTE
							Rel.8. The area of enhancement includes closed subscriber group
							(CSG), self-organizing network (SON), and new functionalities
							such as location information service and MBMS (Multimedia
							Broadcast and Multicast Service).</p>
						<p>
							<img src="./Sai Technology defense_files/govt2.png">
						</p>
						<p>To keep up with the today's rapidly growing traffic,
							especially by the wide spread of smart phone devices, it became
							necessary to achieve much higher level of system performance,
							while keeping the backward compatibility. Accordingly, the radio
							access interface specifications for LTE-Advanced was developed in
							2011. LTE-Advanced (LTE Rel.10 and beyond) sets a major important
							milestone in standardization where meets and exceeds requirements
							set by IMT-Advanced for 4G (International Mobile
							Telecommunications). The new requirements include spectral
							efficiency, higher bandwidth, and lower latency. To meet these
							competitive requirements, a series of new technologies have been
							introduced into LTE-Advanced, such as Carrier Aggregation,
							Enhanced MIMO, and CoMP (Coordinated multi-point
							transmission/reception). LTE-Advanced will enable higher than
							1Gbps downlink bandwidth in addition to the existing LTE service
							and open a new era of true wireless broadband services in the
							near future. LTE-Advanced services will become available from
							leading mobile network operators around 2014. Additional features
							include non-contiguous spectra usage to further enhance the
							current LTE services.</p>
						<p>
							<img src="./Sai Technology defense_files/govt3.png">
						</p>
						<p>SAI Technology has been heavily engaged in LTE product
							development from the early stages of LTE standards. SAI has
							demonstrated complete end to end system solutions for eNodeB and
							UE for LTE-Release 9, 10, 11, and 12. SAI is developing LTE
							advancements to fulfill new and future generations of LTE
							products. SAI delivered LTE Advanced Solutions to the industry
							3GPP Releases supported Release 9, 10, 11, and 12.</p>
						<h5>C-RAN</h5>
						<p>Mobile Data traffic increasing x2 every year with the
							increase in demand for the mobile applications.</p>
						<p>The density of base stations are very high in urban areas
							and it is very difficult to add new Base Station (BS) sites for
							these kind of regions. But still during larger periods of time
							many BS are under used.</p>
						<p>In order to have a high availability and maintainability of
							BS flexibility is needed in order to provide high data rates at
							smaller cost. To achieve flexibility as the demand with minimal
							cost for BS, the BS needs to be Virtualized which makes it as
							C-RAN. SAI Virtualized BS, developed a solution by architecting
							traditional RAN to Virtualized BS transitioning to Cloud RAN
							(C-RAN) to have Dynamic allocation of the processing resources,
							Inter-connection within virtualized BBU pool, I/O Virtualization.</p>
						<p>
							<img src="./Sai Technology defense_files/govt4.png">
						</p>
						<p>Virtualizing a physical BS into multiple logical RAN nodes
							from different mobile network systems, the processing resources
							should be dynamically allocated to a higher load logical RAN node
							so that real-time scheduling and strict processing delay and
							jitter requirements are met. Base Band Unit (BBU) resources in
							C-RAN BBU pool are also required to scale according to the whole
							load of BBU pool. These might require northbound interface to
							virtualization orchestrator in order to manage life-cycle event
							of virtualized processing resources.</p>
						<p>
							<img src="./Sai Technology defense_files/govt5.png">
						</p>
						<p>Inter-connection within virtualized BBU pool shall have
							high bandwidth and low latency switching functions with necessary
							data formats and protocols to inter-connect among multiple BBUs.
						</p>
						<p>With this switching function, BBU pool can realize the
							processing load balancing.</p>
						<p>With our C-RAN solution it has number of benefits such as</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Lower energy consumption.</li>
							<li>Lower CAPEX and OPEX costs.</li>
							<li>Improved Performance by aggregating the resources
								effectively.</li>
							<li>Co-existence with Virtualized and Non-Virtualized
								Networks</li>
							<li>Scalable</li>
							<li>High Availability</li>
						</ul>
						<h5>eNB Base Station</h5>
						<p>On the base station side of the network SAI has developed
							the LTE enhanced node B (eNB) solution to LTE release 9.0, 10.0,
							and 11.0 specification.</p>
						<p>
							<img src="./Sai Technology defense_files/govt6.png">
						</p>
						<h5>This solution is available in Micro, Pico and Femto
							formats and supports</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>3GPP Rel-9, 10, and 11 Compliant</li>
							<li>Bandwidths of 1.4, 3, 5, 20 MHz</li>
							<li>Support of UE Categories 1,2 3, and 4</li>
							<li>SISO and 2x2 MIMO</li>
							<li>User downlink data rates of 30 Mbps or more</li>
							<li>User uplink data rates of 10 Mbps or more</li>
							<li>S1 and X2 interfaces</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							<img src="./Sai Technology defense_files/govt7.png">
						</p>
						<p>SAI has also demonstrated the world’s first 4x4 MIMO
							solution for LTE eNB solutions.</p>
						<p>The eNB procotol stack includes the PHY layer, the MAC,
							RLC, PDCP and RRC layers as well as higher layers needed for
							radio and connection management. In addition, the stack includes
							the assorted backhaul connection management needs including G-TP,
							SCTP S1 and X1.</p>
						<p>The eNB procotol stack is available as a software product
							for third party implementations.</p>

					<strong>1)4G LTE Advanced</strong>
				</h2>
				<h3>4G LTE Advanced</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Overview:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>The Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard defined by 3GPP is a
					highly flexible radio interface that aims at bridging the gap
					between 3G and 4G standards. LTE Release 8 specification was
					completed in 2009 and triggered LTE service deployment by leading
					mobile network operators. It has set various target requirements to
					achieve higher system performance than HSPA in 3GPP Release 6. It
					has improved system capacity, cell edge user throughput and lower
					C/U plane latency, supported by introduction of new radio interface
					technologies, such as OFDM, frequency domain scheduling and MIMO.
					In the following year, LTE Release 9 has also been completed to
					extend various functionalities in LTE Rel.8. The area of
					enhancement includes closed subscriber group (CSG), self-organizing
					network (SON), and new functionalities such as location information
					service and MBMS (Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service).</p>

					<strong>LTE Advanced:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>To keep up with the today's rapidly growing traffic,
					especially by the wide spread of smart phone devices, it became
					necessary to achieve much higher level of system performance, while
					keeping the backward compatibility. Accordingly, the radio access
					interface specifications for LTE-Advanced has been developed in
					2011. LTE-Advanced (LTE Rel.10 and beyond) sets a major important
					milestone in standardization where meets and exceeds requirements
					set by IMT-Advanced for 4G (International Mobile
					Telecommunications). The new requirements include spectral
					efficiency, higher bandwidth, and lower latency. To meet these
					competitive requirements, a series of new technologies have been
					introduced into LTE-Advanced, such as Carrier Aggregation, Enhanced
					MIMO, and CoMP (Coordinated multi-point transmission/reception).
					LTE-Advanced will enable higher than 1Gbps downlink bandwidth in
					addition to the existing LTE service and open a new era of true
					wireless broadband services in the near future. LTE-Advanced
					services will become available from leading mobile network
					operators around 2014. Additional features include non-contiguous
					spectra usage to further enhance the current LTE services.</p>

				<h2>2)802.11 AC / AD / WiGiga</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Overview:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>In 2009, 802.11n was ratified. It provides for up to 4x4 MIMO
					(Single user) along with wider bandwidths and a number of MAC layer
					improvements leading to a peak theoretical throughput in the order
					of 600 Mbps. Since the ratification of 802.11n, a new task group
					(TGac) has begun working on the next standard for even higher
					throughput within &lt;6GHz spectrum. A closely coupled task group
					(TGad) is looking at very high throughput for spectrum &gt;6Ghz
					(such as the 60 Ghz ISM band).</p>
				<p>The IEEE 802.11ac Task Group (TG) has beendeveloping
					amendment to IEEE 802.11 having PHY (Physical layer) as well as MAC
					(Medium Access Control sub layer) enhancements.&nbsp; These are the
					following goals for designing the IEEE 802.11ac amendment.</p>
				<p>&bull; Backward compatibility with IEEE 802.11a and IEEE
					802.11n operated in 5GHz.</p>
				<p>&bull; Single STA throughput: 802.11ac STA shall be capable
					of getting throughput up to 500Mbps.</p>
				<p>&bull; Multi-STA throughput: The aggregate throughput when
					802.11ac system has multiple STAs connected should be greater than
					or equal to 1Gbps.</p>
				<p>New features in this standard are the bandwidths of 80 MHz
					and 160 MHz (11n offered only 40 MHz), 256QAM, up to eight antennas
					and multi-user MIMO.Gross data rates of 293 Mbit/s are possible
					with only 80 MHz bandwidth, one antenna and 64QAM 5/6; all 802.11ac
					devices must support this mode. Optional modes using 256QAM and
					eight antennas under optimal conditions permit gross data rates of
					3.5 Gbit/s. 802.11ac is designed only for license-free 5 GHz bands
					and will no longer include the 2.4 GHz industrial scientific
					medical (ISM) band previously used primarily for WLANs.</p>
				<p>For details on the exact extensions in the PHY layer, see our
					whitepaper on 802.11ac PHY extensions.</p>
				<p>SAI is developing 802.11ac PHY and MAC layer stacks, as well
					as system solutions with particular emphasis on MU-MIMO high
					performance implementation. This work is in collaboration with
					leading silicon and SoC vendors for 802.11ac.&nbsp;</p>

					[Enterprise Class]</p>
				<p>
					<img src="./Sai%20Technology%20defense_files/RnD3.png">
				</p>
				<p>Concurrent with the802.11ac developments, a number of
					industry groups are looking at the ISM band at 60 Ghz (typically
					57-66 Ghz) as the next frontier for WLANs. Clearly, such a high
					center frequency (mm wave) comes with a number of challenges
					including</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Limited range, due to the proximity of the oxygen
						absorption band</li>
					<li>Implementation cost and high power consumption</li>
				</ul>
				<p>MIMO techniques are helping overcome at least some of the
					range issue, and a 32x32 antenna array can be easily implemented on
					a CMOS process. Thus, as these hurdles are overcome the 60 Ghzband
					promises even higher data rates &ndash; up to 7 Gbps.</p>
				<p>The IEEE 802.11ad standard adds a mm wave operating mode to
					the 802.11n with a mmSTA being a station that is capable of mm wave
					operations. Although the base protocol is an extension of 802.11n
					and 802.11ac, a number of mmWave mode specific packets and formats
					have been defined in this standard(for e.g., mmWave CTS). In
					addition, upto 5 bits are reserved for defining the number of
					beams, thus permitting as many as 32 beams.</p>
				<p>Due to the strong dependence on beamforming, considerable
					effort is going into refining the beam forming procedures and
					transactions within the 802.11ad standard. Similarly the large
					number of receive and transmit chains required for such a system
					are pushing the standards committee to refine the power management
					techniques used in 802.11n/ac. MIMO for reducing power consumption
					and turning off some of these chains when not required without
					affecting network latency and performance.</p>
				<p>This standard is in draft and still being developed, although
					initial silicon is available from a select set of companies.</p>
				<p>Besides the 802.11ad standard, a few other standards are
					being pursued for the 60 Ghz ISM band.</p>
				<p>SAI is working with leading 60 GHz chip vendors for 802.11ad
					implementation on CMOS platforms. This work clearly leverages
					SAI&rsquo;s work on 802.11ac with a focus on high performance and
					low power solutions.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>WiGig</strong>
				</p>
				<p>The WiGig specification was contributed to the IEEE 802.11ad
					standardization process, and was confirmed in May 2010 as the basis
					for the 802.11ad draft standard.</p>

					<strong>3)Wireless Video </strong>
				</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Overview:</strong>
				</p>
				<p>In parallel with the 802.11 stream of standards, there has
					been a steady march of Wireless personal area networks towards the
					60 Ghz ISM band as well. In particular the requirements of being
					able to develop a wireless video area network for full HD
					resolution leads towards similarly high data rate requirements.</p>
				<p>The latest Wireless HD 1.1 standard aims for</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Stream uncompressed audio and video up to Quad Full HD
						(QFHD) resolution,</li>
					<li>48 bit color and 240 Hz refresh rates</li>
					<li>Support for 3D video formats</li>
					<li>Efficient data networking using IP</li>
					<li>Flexible wireless connectivity using USB bridging</li>
					<li>Simple, fast file transfer with OBEX.</li>
					<li>Low rate PHY (2.5-40 Mb/s) for omni-directional control
						and discovery</li>
					<li>Medium-rate PHY (0.5-2 Gb/s) for low power, mobile
						applications and lowcomplexityuniversal bi-directional data
						support</li>
					<li>High-rate PHY (1-7 Gb/s) for high quality, full resolution
						video</li>
					<li>Improved coverage and higher data rates (in excess of 28
						Gb/s) through the use of</li>
					<li>The spatial multiplexing high rate PHY (SM-HRP) option</li>
					<li>Video coding to improve link robustness</li>
					<li>HDCP 2.0 in addition to DTCP content protection support</li>
				</ul>
				<p>SAI has completed significant work in video streaming on
					existing protocols &ndash; WiMax, LTE as well as 802.11 in their
					various forms (802.16e, 802.16d, 3G,LTE Rel 9 as well as
					802.11g/n/ac). SAI is extending such video streaming work into the
					Wireless High Definition technologies and markets for high
					performance full resolution video.</p>

					<strong>3) LTE EPC</strong>
				</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>LTE EPS (LTE / SAE ) Architecture</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="./Sai%20Technology%20defense_files/TL11.png">
				</p>
				<p>The EPS architecture is made up of an EPC (Packet Core
					Network) and eUTRAN Radio Access Network.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>EPC Key Network Elements</strong>
				</p>
				<p>The core network (Evolved Packet Core in SAE) is responsible
					for the overall control of the UE and establishment of the bearers.
					The main logical nodes of the EPC are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Mobility Management Entity (MME)</li>
					<li>Serving Gateway (S-GW)</li>
					<li>PDN Gateway (P-GW)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Mobility Management Entity ( MME )</strong>
				</p>
				<p>This is a key control plane element. Among other functions,
					it is in charge of managing security functions (authentication,
					authorization, NAS signaling), handling idle state mobility,
					roaming, and handovers. Also selecting the Serving Gateway (S-GW)
					and Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN-GW) nodes is part of its
					tasks. The S1-MME interface connects the EPC with the eNodeBs.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Serving Gateway ( S &ndash; GW)</strong>
				</p>
				<p>The EPC terminates at this node, and it is connected to the
					E-UTRAN via the S1-U interface. Each UE is associated to a unique
					S-GW, which will be hosting several functions. It is the mobility
					anchor point for both local inter-eNodeB handover and inter 3GPP
					mobility. S-GW performs inter-operator charging as well as packet
					routing and forwarding.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>PDN Gateway ( P &ndash; GW)</strong>
				</p>
				<p>This node provides the UE with access to a Packet Data
					Network (PDN) by assigning an IP address from the PDN to the UE,
					among other functions. Additionally, the evolved Packet Data
					Gateway (ePDG) provides security connection between UEs connected
					from an untrusted non-3GPP access network with the EPC by using
					IPSec tunnels.</p>
				<p>SAI has developed MME, S-GW, P-GW which are fully compliant
					with 3GPP Release 8 and 9.0. SAI is working towards LTE Advanced
					(Release 10 and beyond).</p>
				<p>With licensing UE or eNodeB software, SAI provides EPC
					software running on Intel Servers. These modules are validated with
					rigorous interoperability tests with other vendors.</p>

				<h2>4) LTE Advanced</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>What&rsquo;s new in LTE Advanced</strong>
				</p>
				<p>In the feasibility study for LTE-Advanced, 3GPP determined
					that LTE-Advanced would meet the ITU-R requirements for 4G. The
					results of the study are published in 3GPP Technical Report (TR)
					36.912. Further, it was determined that 3GPP Release 8, 9, and 10
					LTE could meet most of the 4G requirements apart from uplink
					spectral efficiency and the peak data rates. These higher
					requirements are addressed with the addition of the following
					LTE-Advanced features.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Wider bandwidths, enabled by carrier aggregation</li>
					<li>Higher efficiency, enabled by enhanced uplink multiple
						access and enhanced multiple antenna transmission (advanced MIMO
						techniques)</li>
					<li>Coordinated multipoint transmission and reception (CoMP)</li>
					<li>Relaying</li>
					<li>Support for heterogeneous networks</li>
					<li>LTE self-optimizing network (SON) enhancements</li>
					<li>Home enhanced-node-B (HeNB) mobility enhancements</li>
					<li>Fixed wireless customer premises equipment (CPE) RF
						requirements</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>System Performance Requirements</strong>&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					<img src="./Sai%20Technology%20defense_files/TL12.png">
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
						Spectrum Flexibility </strong>
				</p>
				<p>In addition to the bands currently defined for LTE Release 8,
					TR 36.913 identifies the following new bands:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>450&ndash;470 MHz band</li>
					<li>698&ndash;862 MHz band</li>
					<li>790&ndash;862 MHz band</li>
					<li>2.3&ndash;2.4 GHz band</li>
					<li>3.4&ndash;4.2 GHz band</li>
					<li>4.4&ndash;4.99 GHz band</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Some of these bands are now formally included in the 3GPP
					Release 9 and Release 10 specifications. Note that frequency bands
					are considered release independent features, which means that it is
					acceptable to deploy an earlier release product in a band not
					defined until a later release.</p>
				<p>LTE Advanced is designed to operate in spectrum allocations
					of different sizes, including allocations wider than the 20 MHz in
					Release 8, in order to achieve higher performance and target data
					rates. Although it is desirable to have bandwidths greater than 20
					MHz deployed in adjacent spectrum, the limited availability of
					spectrum means that aggregation from different bands is necessary
					to meet the higher bandwidth requirements. This option has been
					allowed for in the IMT-Advanced specifications.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>SAI LTE &ndash; Advanced Development </strong>
				</p>
				<p>SAI is heavily invested in developing complete LTE solution
					for 3GPP LTE Release 10 and beyond (LTE Advanced). The areas of
					enhancements are based on current solutions described in LTE UE and
					eNodeB. The EPC cores are being upgraded to support full system
					validation based on solutions described in LTE EPC page.</p>
